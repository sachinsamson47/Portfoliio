This is a quick sql project that I did to compare the mortality rate of covid patients and smokers by country.



The data (owid-covid-data.xlsx) was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and an additional file webscraped from wikipedia was also used which contains the sex ratio by country 
to compute the population by gender.


The source file had data from 01/01/2020 to 26/05/2021.



Tableau dashboard coming soon....
